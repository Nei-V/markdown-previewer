import NEWTEXT from '../constants'

let a=`# Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer!

## This is a sub-heading...
### And here's some other cool stuff:
  
Heres some code, \`<div></div>\`, between 2 backticks.

\`\`\`
// this is multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine == \'\`\`\`\' && lastLine == \'\`\`\`\') {
    return multiLineCode;
  }
}

\`\`\`
<b>bold</b>  

You can also make text **bold**... whoa! 
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.com), and
> Block Quotes!

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.


1. And there are numbererd lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want! 
1. But the list goes on...
- Even if you use dashes or asterisks.
* And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:

![React Logo w/ Text](https://goo.gl/Umyytc)`;

const showText = (state = a,action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case NEWTEXT:
        console.log("new state");
        console.log("fullText after dispatch",action.fullText);
        return action.fullText;
        default:
        console.log("old state");
        return state;
    }
}
console.log("showText in reducer ",showText);
export default showText;
